# classification augmentation by reinforcement learning



## summary

This repo is for text classification data augmentation. We use generative language models: GPT2, T5 etc to synthesize augmentated samples and inject them back to original training data, to train a improved classifier.
Filtering mechanism is also employed to reject synthetic samples of low quality.


## baseline

EDA, back-translation, CBERT, LAMBDA

## backbone classifier

Albert
